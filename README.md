My first javascript calculator 


In my journey to change careers I am learning front end web development. This little project is just practice to get used to working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. In all honesty, it didn't go as I had thought it would. I was completely overthinking it. I understand that eval() isn't the best way to get this done but I went with that to keep it simple. There is also no validation to make sure the user isn't adding a + (. The plan currently is to rework this app with added features and better functionality.
